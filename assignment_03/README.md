# Fundamentals of Generative AI - Assignment 03

## What are Compound AI Systems?

Compound AI systems are advanced AI systems that combine different AI models, tools, and methods to solve complex problems more effectively than using just one model. By combining different components such as Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) which uses web search to bring in real-time information, APIs for connecting different tools and services, and retrievers to access specific data, these systems are better equipped to handle real world challenges. They can work faster, use resources more efficiently, and manage more complex tasks, making them especially useful in areas like healthcare, finance, and self-driving cars.

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous systems that can set goals, plan actions, and learn from their experiences in real world or simulated environments. They go beyond simple models by integrating compound AI systems to act intelligently and independently. These agents can perform complex tasks, make decisions, and adapt to new information or environments without human intervention.

## Relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents

Compound AI systems form the backbone of AI agents by providing the intelligence needed to perform complex tasks. AI agents build on this by adding autonomy allowing the system to act and learn from its environment. In essence, compound AI systems supply the necessary components while AI agents utilize these components to function independently and achieve goals.

## Difference between Fine Tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) are two approaches to enhancing AI model performance but they work differently. Fine-tuning involves training a pre-existing model on a specific dataset to specialize it for a particular task, making it more accurate for that context. RAG on the other hand enhances a model by dynamically integrating external knowledge during inference, allowing it to provide more relevant and up to date responses without needing re-training. While fine-tuning adjusts the modelâ€™s parameters, RAG augments the model with real-time information retrieval, making it more adaptable to changing data.
